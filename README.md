# seahorce-notebooks

### Set up seahorce environment

To get started download [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), and then use the `conda` command to create an environment called `seahorce` based on the `seahorce.yml` file in the repository:

    conda env create -f seahorce.yml

Now launch an instance of jupyterlab from the command line:

    jupyter lab

A browser window will start up, and you can navigate to the notebooks you want to work with.
