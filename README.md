# seahorce-notebooks

### Set up seahorce environment

To get started download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), then use the `conda` command to create an environment called `seahorce` based on the `seahorce.yml` file in the repository:

    conda env create -f seahorce.yml
    
Activate that environment, if not already,

    conda activate seahorce

Now launch an instance of jupyterlab from the command line:

    jupyter lab

A browser window will start up, and you can navigate to the notebooks you want to work with.
